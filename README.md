# Mintlify Landing Page Clone

This project is a recreation of the Mintlify landing page, built using semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Uses semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for better structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**:
  - **CSS Variables**: Extensive use of variables for consistent theming (colors, fonts, spacing).
  - **Flexbox**: Used for flexible layouts in the navigation bar, hero section, and card grids.
  - **CSS Grid**: utilized for complex layouts where appropriate.
  - **Scroll-Driven Animations**: Implements `animation-timeline` for dynamic scroll effects, such as the changing navbar styles.
  - **Keyframe Animations**: Custom animations for interactive feedback and visual engagement.
  - **Backdrop Filter**: Creates a glassmorphism effect for the sticky header.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- `css/style.css`: Contains all the styles, variables, and media queries.
- `images/`: Directory for all image assets and SVGs.
